    <td>In this lab, we will build on the functions that we have written in the previous lab, `calc1`, and create the logic for a six-function calculator web application with a <b>minimal</b> front-end user interface that the user can click and interact with.</td>

## 0 &ensp; Notes about the Starter Code
1. We have copied the function `calculate` you have already written from lab `calc1` into `calc.js` as starter code, with the modification that we are now using `Math.pow`; you should not need to modify this function to complete the lab.
2. This lab does not focus on CSS; as such, you should not need to modify `./css/calc.css`.
3. If you have any questions, please ask!
